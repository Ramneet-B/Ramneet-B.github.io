    <p>I am a computer science student currently studying at Simon Fraser University. I'm creating
        this website as my first attempt at web development, which is something I want to master eventually.
        In my spare time I enjoy working out, playing video games, working on cars, and tinkering with side projects.
        This purpose of this site is to showcase my projects and experiences.
